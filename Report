Step I: Scanner

Step II: Parser Generator
	First let me go into the assumptions we made for the parser generator:
		* EPSILON is what we used for the epsilon symbol.
		* $ is a reserved symbol and cannot be in the input grammar or an error will be thrown.
		* Input is case sensitive i.e. different case = different symbol
		* Nonterminal rules do NOT have to have <> around them; they only have to be declared in the nonterminal section.
		* Nonterminals cannot contain a space inside <> i.e. you can't have <EXP LIST> as a nonterminal

	The example we will use for the explanations is a simple grammar describing a list separated by semicolons:
		<EXP> : ( <INNERLIST> ) | ( )
		<INNERLIST> : <INNERLIST> ; INT | INT
	If you want to check each of these steps for some other langauge, you can run the parser generator in verbose mode (see README).


	Step II(a): Removal of Left Recursion and Common Prefixes
		For this step we transfered the pseudocode from the book to a more object oriented syntax.  The parser
		generator (ParserGenerator.java) has functions removeSelfLeftRecursion and removeCommonPrefixes which 
		iterates over each nonterminal grammar rule (NonterminalRule.java) and calls their encapsulated functions
		of the same name (removeSelfLeftRecursion and removeCommonPrefixes).  Within each nonterminal rule 
		rucursion removal and common prefix removal is executed and the functions return a new rule if one was
		created (ie if run on A we return A').  The parser then adds the new rule-prime to the nonterminal 
		rule list and continues.


		Let us consider what would happen if we ran parserGenerator.removeSelfRecursion() on our example grammer.
			parserGenerator would iterate through each nonterminal grammar rule, nonterm, calling nonterm.removeSelfRecursion().
				parserGenerator would first call removeSelfRecursion on <EXP>.  
						Since there is no self-left-recursion in <EXP> 
						it would return null because we don't need <EXP'>.
				parserGenerator would then call removeSelfRecursion on <INNERLIST>.  
						This would adjust <INNERLIST>'s rule to be   INT <INNERLIST'>
						and would return   <INNERLIST'>: ; INT <INNERLIST'> | EPSILON 
						which would be added to our rules by parserGenerator.
				parserGenerator would first call removeSelfRecursion on <INNERLIST'>.  
						Since there is no self-left-recursion in <INNERLIST'> 
						it would return null because we don't need <INNERLIST''>.
		Our new grammar rules are:
			<EXP>:  ( <INNERLIST> ) | ( )
			<INNERLIST>:  INT <INNERLIST'>
			<INNERLIST'>:  ; INT <INNERLIST'> | EPSILON				


		Let us consider what would happen if we ran parserGenerator.removeCommonPrefixes() on our example grammer:
			parserGenerator would iterate through each nonterminal grammar rule, nonterm, calling nonterm.removeCommonPrefixes().
				parserGenerator would first call removeCommonPrefixes on <EXP>. 
						This would adjust <EXP>'s rule to be    ( <EXP'>    
						and would return   <EXP'>:  <INNERLIST> ) | )
						which would be added to our rules by parserGenerator.
				parserGenerator would then call removeCommonPrefixes on <EXP'>.  
						Since there are no common prefixes in <EXP'> 
						it would return null because we don't need <EXP''>.
				parserGenerator would then call removeCommonPrefixes on <INNERLIST>.
						Since there are no common prefixes in <INNERLIST> 
						it would return null because we don't need <INNERLIST'>.
				parserGenerator would first call removeCommonPrefixes on <INNERLIST'>.
						Since there are no common prefixes in <INNERLIST'> 
						it would return null because we don't need <INNERLIST''>.
		Our new grammar rules are:
			<EXP>:  ( <EXP'>
			<EXP'>:  <INNERLIST> ) | )
			<INNERLIST>:  INT <INNERLIST'>
			<INNERLIST'>:  ; INT <INNERLIST'> | EPSILON
		Note the lack of self-left-recursion and common prefixes.


	StepII(b): Building First Set, Follow Set, and Parse Table
		Like the previous step, we simply implemented the pseudocode from the book in a more OO way.  

		We calculate the first and follow set using the parser generator's constructFirst and constructFollow 
		functions.  These function iterate over each nonterminal grammar rule and calls their encapsulated 
		functions of the same name (constructFirst and constructFollow).  Within the nonterminal rule the 
		algorithm in the Louden Textbook is executed and a boolean representing whether the individual 
		nonterminal rules' first or follow set was updated is returned.  The parser continues to iterate through the 
		nonterminals until no changes to their first/follow sets occur.


		Let us consider what happens if we run parserGenerator.constructFirst() on our example grammar:
			parserGenerator loop through each of the nonterminal rules calling their encapsulated
			constructFirst method until none of them report a change in their first sets.
				(I will spare the grammar rule level detail since this can iterate for quite a while)
		Our new first set is formed correctly:
			First set for <EXP> -> ( <EXP'>:			( 
			First set for <EXP'> -> <INNERLIST> ):			INT
			First set for <EXP'> -> ):				)
			First set for <INNERLIST> -> INT <INNERLIST'>:		INT
			First set for <INNERLIST'> -> ; INT <INNERLIST'>:	;
			First set for <INNERLIST'> -> EPSILON:			EPSILON


		Let us consider what happens if we run parserGenerator.constructFollow() on our example grammar:
			parserGenerator loop through each of the nonterminal rules calling their encapsulated
			constructFollow method until none of them report a change in their follow sets.
				(I will spare the grammar rule level detail since this can iterate for quite a while)
		Our new follow set is formed correctly:
			Follow set for <EXP>:		$
			Follow set for <EXP'>:		$
			Follow set for <INNERLIST>:	)
			Follow set for <INNERLIST'>:	)


		Forming the parse table is quite simple after we have the first and follow sets.  We form the parse 
		table by calling the parser generator's createParseTable function.  It simply loops through all the 
		nonterminals and loops through each of the terminals.  If the nonterminal contains the terminal in 
		its first set then the correlating production rule is added to the parse table.  If the nonterminal's 
		first set contains epsilon then epsilon is added to the parse table for all of the follow terminal entries.

		Here's what the parse table looks like before we consider EPSILON:
				|	(	|	)	|	INT		|	    ;		|	$	|
		<EXP>		|   ( <EXP'>	|		|			|			|		|
		<EXP'>		|		|	)	|    <INNERLIST> )	|			|		|
		<INNERLIST>	|		|		|   INT <INNERLIST'>	|			|		|
		<INNERLIST'>	|		|		|			|   ; INT <INNERLIST'>	|		|

		Now when we consider the first set of <INNERLIST'> contains EPSILON, the resulting parse table looks like this:
				|	(	|	)	|	INT		|	    ;		|	$	|
		<EXP>		|   ( <EXP'>	|		|			|			|		|
		<EXP'>		|		|	)	|    <INNERLIST> )	|			|		|
		<INNERLIST>	|		|		|   INT <INNERLIST'>	|			|		|
		<INNERLIST'>	|		|    EPSILON	|			|   ; INT <INNERLIST'>	|		|


	Step II(c)
		Once we have the parse table parsing is quite simple.  The parser (Parser.java) starts out with 
		an input list, a parse stack that contains only the start symbol, and the parse table.  The parser 
		loops until the stack and input is empty or an error has occured doing the following:
			if the top of the stack is a nonterminal 
				then we add the parse table entry for that nonterminal and the current input symbol to the stack. (generate)
			if the top of the stack is a terminal 
				then we make sure that it matches the current input symbol 
				and we pop off the top of the stack and get the next input symbol. (match)
			if any entry in the parse table is empty or the input symbol and stack don't match 
				then we throw an error.

		For example for the input ( INT ; INT )
		   INPUT		    STACK		ACTION
		( INT ; INT ) $		<EXP> $			generate
		( INT ; INT ) $		( <EXP'> $		match
		INT ; INT ) $		<EXP'> $		generate
		INT ; INT ) $		<INNERLIST> ) $		generate
		INT ; INT ) $		INT <INNERLIST'> ) $	match
		; INT ) $		<INNERLIST'> ) $	generate
		; INT ) $		; INT <INNERLIST'> ) $	match
		) $			<INNERLIST'> ) $	match
		) $			<INNERLIST'> ) $	generate
		) $			EPSILON ) $		match (our implementation can put epsilon on the stack, but pops it off when detected)
		) $			) $			match
		$			$			match
								match
